##  Use Case

This project is useful for:
- Developers seeking to build LinkedIn-based applications
- Data professionals exploring people analytics
- Researchers analyzing professional networks
- Students learning API usage vs scraping ethics

##  Technologies and Tools

- **Google Slides** (presentation)
- **Manual research** (LinkedIn documentation, TOS)
- **API documentation analysis**
- **Market tools review** (e.g., Phantombuster, Bright Data)

##  Key Insights

- LinkedInâ€™s API is very limited and difficult to access for personal or commercial use.
- Web scraping LinkedIn directly is risky and can result in legal and account consequences.
- Third-party tools and extensions can work but are often expensive and come with compliance risks.
- Ethical data usage should always be prioritized over easy access.
